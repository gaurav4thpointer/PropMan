# PropMan — Sales Pitch

---

## One line

**Stop chasing rent in spreadsheets. See every property, cheque, and rupee in one place.**

---

## The problem

You own a few flats. You collect PDCs. You track rent in notes, WhatsApp, or Excel. Sound familiar?

- **“Which cheque did I deposit?”** — PDC status is scattered.
- **“Who’s overdue?”** — No clear view of expected vs received.
- **“Where’s the lease copy?”** — Documents live in folders and emails.
- **“When does this lease end?”** — Renewals and vacancies sneak up on you.

Result: missed follow-ups, unclear cash flow, and hours spent reconciling by hand.

## The shift

**PropMan** is a simple, secure web app built for landlords in **India** and **Dubai**. One login. One dashboard. Your whole rental picture — properties, tenants, leases, cheques, and payments — in one place.

No spreadsheets. No sticky notes. Just a single source of truth that works on desktop and mobile.

## What you get

| You get | So you can |
|--------|------------|
| **Portfolio at a glance** | See every property and unit, INR or AED, with occupancy and rent in one view. |
| **Leases that work for you** | Set start/end, rent, due day, frequency — get auto-generated rent schedules and optional early termination. |
| **PDC tracking that makes sense** | Log cheques once; move them from received → deposited → cleared (or bounced/replaced) without digging through papers. |
| **Payments tied to rent** | Record payments and match them to schedule lines so you know what’s paid, partial, or overdue. |
| **Documents in one place** | Attach agreements and IDs to leases with optional display names; download or remove when you need to. |
| **Dashboard that answers “How am I doing?”** | Month/quarter expected vs received, overdue amounts, upcoming cheques, expiring leases, and total money tracked. |

## Who it’s for

- **Individual landlords** with one or more residential properties in India or UAE who want clarity without complexity.
- **Small managers or family offices** who need simple income and PDC tracking, not enterprise software.

One account = one owner. Your data stays yours, secured with email + password.
